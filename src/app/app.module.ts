// For a standalone Angular 19 application, app.module.ts is typically not used
// for declaring components, services, or modules in the traditional way.
// It might exist as a minimal file for bootstrapping purposes, especially if
// you have some legacy setup or specific tooling that still expects it.

// If you started with `ng new --standalone`, this file might not even exist by default,
// or it might look something like this if generated for a hybrid app.

// This example is a placeholder for `app.module.ts` in a standalone context,
// where the main application configuration is handled by `app.config.ts`.

import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser'; // Import BrowserModule if bootstrapping from a module

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    // Components, directives, and pipes that belong to this module
    // In a standalone app, these would typically be imported directly in the component files
  ],
  imports: [
    // Modules whose exported declarables are available to templates in this module
    // For a standalone app, you might not need many imports here if bootstrapping directly via app.config.ts
    BrowserModule // Needed for web applications to run in a browser environment
  ],
  providers: [
    // Services that can be injected into components
    // In a standalone app, most providers are defined in app.config.ts
  ],
  bootstrap: [
    // The root component of the application.
    // In a standalone app, the root component is typically bootstrapped via `bootstrapApplication`
    // in `main.ts` using `app.config.ts`.
